        <p>Whether hitting my favorite restaurant or staying in and cooking, I love food and the way it brings people together. Food is a required part of life so it might as well be enjoyed. I have created this page specifically for food, so I can dive deeply into the fare I love. Below I'll cover dishes I enjoy, restaurants I enjoy, and the most delicious and easy dishes I've created.</p>

        <h2>Cooking Adventures</h2>
        <p>Some of the best things I've eaten are the things I've made myself. Being a bit lazy and not one for extremely technical dishes, you can be sure that these dishes can be pulled off by just about anyone. It's also important to note that many dishes cannot be done at home to the same standard as a restaurant. I know it. These are dishes that are not only still good at home, but potentially better for the ability to curtail them to your exact liking as well as being able to eat the dish when it's at peak freshness.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creamy Lemon & Boursin Orzo Bake</li>
            <li>Crispy Feta Fried Egg over Avacado Toast</li>
            <li>Roasted Bacon Brussel Sprouts with Salted Honey</li>
            <li>Crispy Smashed Sweet Potatoes with Feta Garlic dip</li>
        </ul>
