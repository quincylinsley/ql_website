  <h2>Best Waterfalls</h2>
  <p>For those who understand the splendor of water falling from the heavens, I've included a list of the most magical waterfalls I've encountered. Some are big, some small--many come and go with the seasons, but all have caused wonder within me.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Havasupi-no one waterfall can be singled out in this gorgeous canyon, all were the brightest blue and the most magical. Contrasted against the reddish rocks..this is one not to miss.</li>
    <li>Gunlock Falls- This is far from the most beautiful waterfall, but go in the spring and you'll discover the change that a large amount of water can make to a space. Most of the year, this waterfall is more of a trickle, but when the snow melts and the water starts flowing, this desert falls erupts with cascading water and people. Somehow though it creates a sense of community and group wonder that keeps things magical.</li>
    <li>Kipu Falls- located deep in the Hawaiian jungle on the island of Hawaii, these falls are truly a playland for all. It is a trek to get there, but once there, the rope swing and cliff jumping are superior to most. Magical and mysterious, these are falls not to miss.
    </li>
    <li>Bells Canyon Falls- you would never know from looking at the mountains here what magestic falls lay within. This canyon is a beautiful hike, but the waterfall 2.5 miles in is well worth the trek.</li>
  </ul>
