    <p>This page is all about my hobbies. Some are lame, some are challenging--many will result in nothing more than time used and experience gained. But that's what hobbies are for! Also, what a strange word...hobbies..the more I look at it the stranger it looks. But hopefully you can find something here that will guide you to a hobby or adventure that will stick with you. </p>

    <h2>Lazy Hobbies</h2>
    <p>It's important to distinguish between lazy hobbies and non-lazy hobbies so that when determining which hobby to pursue you can select appropriately. Pursuing an active hobby, either physically or mentally, may have negative results if the endeavor takes place during a time of fatigue. Below I have created a list for myself of hobbies that require very little from me either physically or mentally.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>tv show or movie with simple plot</li>
        <li>swinging</li>
        <li>puzzle</li>
        <li>neighborhood walk</li>
        <li>carwash and drink run</li>
        <li>people watching in the park</li>
        <li>coffee shop hang</li>
        <li>movie theatre</li>
        <li>meditation</li>
    </ul>
